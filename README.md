# Advanced Fizzbuzz

## Description
Building on the first fizzbuzz assignment, we now needed fizzbuzz-ish results returned on an unknown list of number/word pairs. After reviewing this initially, I had some difficulty conceptualizing how to structure this problem and code. Marco was awesome in helping me to see how to build the solution step by step, which we did on the whiteboard.
